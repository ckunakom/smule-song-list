# Smule: Songs List

Scrape attempt for some Smule user's app data ðŸ˜’

>Get a list of songs (and more) you recorded together with your favorite Smulean! 

ðŸ‘† That was the case back in 2021.

â›” As of 2023, Smule team seems to have truncated the data you can get from the 'data source' URL: https://www.smule.com/s/profile/performance/username 

The information on the recordings are only limited to the user's favorite directory as opposed to all recordings a user has in their account.

### TOOLS
Everything you need is in the `Resources` folder.

- Add the username in the `config.py file` (or if you want, you can add the username directly within the code too)

- Run the code in the jupyter notebook
  - You will need the following libraries for this project: `json`, `pandas`, `request`.

### Heads-up
You will not be able to access Smule app for a while after running this program:

You may also not be able to `request` the data after 1-2 runs. As a workaround, I use [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) (it's free!) 

It is a little cumbersome to having to disconnect and reconnect to get a different IP address each time, but it is better than waiting for 7-30 days just to get the data... and unable to use your app ðŸ˜’

### Context and Lament
[Smule](https://www.smule.com/) is a social singing app you can use to sing either on your own or with others. I was obssessed with trying to get my user's data because I have favorite people that I sing with, so I created this program to do that.

Unfortunately, Smule does not have any sort of API endpoints where you can get your data easily. After a bunch of googling, I came across a URL (mentioned above) where you can put <i>anyone's username</i> for the user's parameter and you will get a json data. <i> Nope! Not secure at all. </i> 

Have I tried emailed Smule team about this? Yes, and they basically wish me luck using what I have and that was it.
