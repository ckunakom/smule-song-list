### Note about `main.ipynb`: 
Old, OG file. This was created to grab data from two different users back in 2021. It will look different and might have a lot of 'overly excited comments'. Use it as a playground or for testing if needed. Otherwise, feel free to ignore it.

Add the username in the `config.py file` (or if you want, you can add the username directly within the code too)
